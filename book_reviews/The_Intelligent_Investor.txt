Important Points:
* Stocks and Bonds, while offering second by second liquidity, should not be treated differently than any other investment. They are an investment instrument with hidden coupons that the investor must themselves estimate.
* Dollar Cost Averaging is a great way to average into a volatile or ultra-longterm position.
* During bull runs the average person believes the recent positive years in the stock market show how "safe" it is as an investment while paying no concern to how overbought shares become or how far detached from the cashflow they provide relative to their share price. Then, when a crash occurs, they put almost no money into the stock market as this correction is, in their eyes, a sign that the market is too risky an investment and has not simply reverted back to or past reasonable levels of price to cashflow for these firms.
* A sound strategy for the "Defensive Investor" is to have his investments split between stocks and bonds; with no less than 25% and no more than 75% in each catagory depending on how overbought the market is. He should dollar cost average a portion of his income every month into the market to various funds and not try to time / predict anything.
* IPO Stands for "It's Probably Overpriced", the highest number of IPOs occur during a bull run period so get the highest value for their company's stock. NOT to give public investors a 'deal.'
* The various methods used in the history of the stock market which try to predict market cycles and their timing have not worked in the long run. "Professional" hedge fund managers don't know what the market will do or when. "In the late 1990s, the forecasts of “market strategists” became more influential than ever before. They did not, unfortunately, become more accurate. On March 10, 2000, the very day that the NASDAQ composite index hit its all-time high of 5048.62, Prudential Securities’s chief technical analyst Ralph Acampora said in USA Today that he expected NASDAQ to hit 6000 within 12 to 18 months. Five weeks later, NASDAQ had already shriveled to 3321.29—but Thomas Galvin, a market strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, declared that “there’s only 200 or 300 points of downside for the NASDAQ and 2000 on the upside.” It turned out that there were no points on the upside and more than 2000 on the downside, as NASDAQ kept crashing until it finally scraped bottom on October 9, 2002, at 1114.11."
* Great Excerpt: "A substantial rise in the market is at once a legitimate reason for satisfaction and a cause for prudent concern, but it may also bring a strong temptation toward imprudent action. Your shares have advanced, good! You are richer than you were, good! But has the price risen too high, and should you think of selling? Or should you kick yourself for not having bought more shares when the level was lower? Or worst thought of all—should you now give way to the bull-market atmosphere, become infected with the enthusiasm, the overconfi dence and the greed of the great public (of which, after all, you are a part), and make larger and dangerous commitments? Presented thus in print, the answer to the last question is a self-evident no, but even the intelligent investor is likely to need considerable will power to keep from following the crowd."
* The interesting thing Ben Graham mentions in this book is at times when the bull market reaches a fevered pitch, people should alternate from bonds to stocks in the 25% and 75% guidelines we mentioned above, so as to do something and feel that they are having an impact on their portfolio, making active choice so they don't get sucked into the bull run frenzy.
* An interesting paradox graham makes in the section "Business Valuations vs. Stock Market Valuations" is that the best companies will almost always be trading at premium to their net asset values. Said another way, the better the history of the company and their earning potential (which we like in a good investment) the higher the premium would be above fair value (which makes the investment more speculative). This causes most good companies to trade above fair value and fluctuate above that level based on how confident people are in paying that premium above fair value for the stock.
* Be on the lookout for stocks that are facing temporary headwinds and that have been sold down to a level of close to or within a cheap multiple of the revenues. EX: A&P shares were trading cheaply in 1938 even with strong revenues, "Why? First, because there were threats of special taxes on chain stores; second, because net profits had fallen off in the previous year; and, third, because the general market was depressed. The first of these reasons was an exaggerated and eventually groundless fear; the other two were typical of temporary  influences."
* THE MOST IMPORTANT EXCERPT: But note this important fact: The true investor scarcely ever is forced to sell his shares, and at all other times he is free to disregard the current price quotation. He need pay attention to it and act upon it only to the extent that it suits his book, and no more.* Thus the investor who permits himself to be stampeded or unduly worried by unjustified market declines in his holdings is perversely transforming his basic advantage into a basic disadvantage. That man would be better off if his stocks had no market quotation at all, for he would then be spared the mental anguish caused him by other persons’ mistakes of judgment.†
* It's as if someone is constantly telling you the price he is willing to pay for the shares of companies you have and his overreactions on the downside when it becomes undervalued are buying opportunities and his runnaway bull runs are selling opportunities if they become overvalued. Listen to your own insights, look at quarterly reports and make your own judgement of value.
* Graham highlights this point in CH8 and I recall Peter Lynch, Warren Buffet, and others echoing the same statement in various interviews: "Investing is't a high-IQ game, it's about controlling your emotions and working hard to find good picks." In fact, research says that our brains are wired to find patterns in randomness even when there aren't any patterns. We also feel twice as much pain when a stock we're holding goes down than the amount of pleasure we feel when it goes up! This is why most people sell at the bottom and don't buy in when the stock is relatively cheap.
* Sometimes selling at a loss makes sense. In fact you can write off up to $3,000 of ordinary income every year from stock market gains. So if you had 200 shares of coke that went from $12,000 in value to $8,800, that's a $3,200 loss. You could sell these shares at the lower level for a loss, then after 31 days purchase them back at the same price (hopefully) which means you clocked in a loss AND you get to keep the same number of shares)
* Recap on Funds: Most funds don't make more alpha than the S&P enough to justify their fees, funds that outperform the market don't do so for long. BUT INDEX funds offer a good way to diversify your assets so you don't have to spend your time picking stocks if you don't want to.
* Another tidbit to find a fund that might outperform: So first find a low-cost fund whose managers are major shareholders, dare to be different, don’t hype their returns, and have shown a willingness to shut down before they get too big for their britches. Then, and only then, consult their Morningstar rating. 10 Finally, look at past performance, remembering that it is only a pale predictor of future returns. As we’ve already seen, yesterday’s winners often become tomorrow’s losers. But researchers have shown that one thing is almost certain: Yesterday’s losers almost never become tomorrow’s winners. So avoid funds with consistently poor past returns—especially if they have above-average annual expenses.
* Hire a fee based advisor for big shifts / changes in portfolio and ask them to help lay our a strategy that will keep your worst tendencies from nuking your portfolio.
* The most basic possible definition of a good business is this: It generates more cash than it consumes. Good managers keep finding ways of putting that cash to productive use. In the long run, companies that meet this definition are virtually certain to grow in value, no matter what the stock market does.
* Start reading financial reports backwards, all the hidden stuff a company doesn't want you to know is back there. Also , alway read the footnotes.
*CH13: Try to buy close to book value, look at the fundamentals of the business (increasing revenues, moats, steady dividends, consistent industry demand) and don't get wrapped up in the stock price. Be weary of huge revnue growth from small companies and people saying it will continue into the future, it's harder for a bigger company to grow as fast. Look out for conpanies like "Exodus" that was growing sales quickly but losing money at an increasing rate, borrowing large ammounts of cash and it's price is still increaseing. Of the four stocks outlined in the CH13 comments the two with P/B ratios close to 1, either lost only 4% or make 20% during the dot com bubble of 1999-2003.
*CH15: And the thrust of these studies that mutual funds, on average, under perform the market by a margin roughly equal to their operating expenses and trading costs has been reconfirmed so many times that anyone who doubts them should found a financial chapter of the flat earth society. So watch out, it's not easy to outperform the market. However, graham argues that most of the analysts and funds focus on growth stocks and industries, being willing to pay any price for the potential of their limitless growth. While at the same time they shun and disregard the more boring industrues especially when they have been hard hit cyclically when they are at the best values. Yesterdays losers can be tomorrow's winners. ROIC is a better metric than EPS, its more honestly tracking profits divided by shares. Warren buffet's method for picking stocks is to find companies that are financially healthy, have great brand names, and have near monopolies, but are just going through a temporary scandal or storm cloud. He buys these great companies for a good price rather than good companies for a great price. He posts annual letters and explains his thinking very clearly in them so that's awesome! Graham's advice is to look for comapanies that are in good financial condition (current assets at least 1.5 times current liabilities, debt not more than 110% of current assets), earnings stability (company has been profitable every year for the past 5 years), some current dividend, earnings growth, price is less than 120% of net tangible assets. You now can begin winnowing the stocks down to fewer than 15 with a human element and selecting businesses you understand more.
*CH17: The four cases to learn from show that an analyst needs to: check the fundamentals of the business against competitors to look for financial strength, watch out for "serial aquierer" companies as they can take on too much debt in order to grow at a breakneck pace, a merger where a tiny firm took over a huge one with the use of a lot of debt, and finally investors will buy anything and everything not paying any attention to the financials or future of the company as long as they can convince themselves of some type of growth. This is good for a value investor though as it creates buying opportunities.
*CH20: The key to warren buffet's strategy is his goal of achieving a margin of safety for his clients. Even benjamin graham was focused on that goal. He put 25% of his entire fund into Geico, and on the oustide that seems risky, but in reality he knew that he could at least liquidate the entire company for as much as he bought it for and had a lot more upward potential. You are trying to select a stock that has the most number of "failsafes" so that you will not lose money. Positive revenue growth, positive demand trends, cheap multiples, institutional interest, low debt, great management, etc. The worst mistakes Graham has seen people make is not paying too much for a great company, but buying sub-par companies that don't have the earnings history or have only seen good times. "And a true margin of safety is one that can be demonstrated by figures, by persuasive reasoning, and by reference to a body of actual experience."Graham is saying that there is no such thing as a good or bad stock; there are only cheap stocks and expensive stocks. Even the best company becomes a “sell” when its stock price goes too high, while the worst company is worth buying if its stock goes low enough. The very people who considered technology and telecommunications stocks a “sure thing” in late 1999 and early 2000, when they were hellishly overpriced, shunned them as “too risky” in 2002—even though, in Graham’s exact words from an earlier period, “the price depreciation of about 90% made many of these securities exceedingly attractive and reasonably safe.” Similarly, Wall Street’s analysts have always tended to call a stock a “strong buy” when its price is high, and to label it a “sell” after its price has fallen—the exact opposite of what Gra- ham (and simple common sense) would dictate. As he does throughout the book, Graham is distinguishing speculation—or buying on the hope that a stock’s price will keep going up—from investing, or buying on the basis of what the underlying business is worth.
*PS: Don't lose money, it's so much harder to make your investment principle back after losing it, you have to keep taking on more and more risk just to get even. The consequences must dominate the discussion of risk.
