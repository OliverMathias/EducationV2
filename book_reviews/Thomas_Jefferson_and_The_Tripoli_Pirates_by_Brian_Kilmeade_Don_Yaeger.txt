This recounting of a little known but hugely influential battle in American history is 
one of the most captivating books I have ever read. I believe this stems from the book's ability to 
connect the events of the war and decisions made by our leaders at that time to larger national 
outcomes and even American foreign policy tendencies and precidents in modern times.

The author's ability to interweave the personal details of the parties involved really humanizes the 
"cast" of this book and makes them all the more relatable. 

The Tripolian War included:
*    The First American Battle Fought on Foreign Soil
*    The First Civilized Nation Standing up to Pirates Rather Than Paying Tributes
*    A War in Defense of National Commerce
*    The Creation of the U.S. Navy
*    The Creation of the U.S. Marines
*    The First Attempt by the U.S. to Depose a Foreign Leader by Replacing Him with Another


Brian Kilmeade and Don Yaeger have made learning history a joy and I would recommend this book to anyone who's had trouble finishing a book in the past, it'll get you out of your rut!
