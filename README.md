A Repository for Documenting my Alternative Approach to Post Secondary Education.

## Reasons for Pursuing an Unconventional Approach
* Degrees have come to be used as an "easy to judge" proxy value for the quality of potential employees, ex. "when in doubt hire the one with the degree." In the example of production worker supervisors, 16% of people working in the position today hold bachelor's degrees, while 67% of job listings for production worker supervisors require bachelor's degrees [1](https://www.forbes.com/sites/prestoncooper2/2018/01/08/employers-demanding-college-degrees-weaken-the-economy/?sh=7be4b1066b11). If this trend of "degree inflation" continues, higher and higher levels of educational attainment will be required  to "signal" that a candidate is qualified.

* Adjusted for inflation, the average cost of attendance at a four year university has increased 97% from 1980 to 2018, with real median wages for degree holders only increasing 9% over the same period [2](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45090.pdf). This points to a drastic "devaluing" in the premium earnings between college graduates and non-college graduates, with the cost of higher education increasing almost 8X faster than wages [3](https://whoisnnamdi.com/the-value-of-college/)[4](https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/07/24/price-of-college-increasing-almost-8-times-faster-than-wages/?sh=245a3ddf66c1). A similar "devaluing" of master's degrees could ensue if degrees continue to be used as the default qualifying signal for HR departments as mentioned in the point above.  

* I'm still unsure of what I want to do with my life, so designing an inexpensive learning strategy with a wide scope seems logical. This builds a base of general knowledge in multiple fields, allowing me to "dive deeper" into one or more of them in the future.

* I'm fairly certain I want to work for myself, so the "certification" portion of a degree becomes much less valuable and the "learning" portion becomes the most important piece. With this new importance imbalance, I believe there are much more cost effective ways to learn the material and master relevant skills than the conventional graduate degree model.

* Building a habit of self-learning and picking the "questions" I would like to answer is a valuable skill for an entrepreneur. Especially in a world like ours with sparse & delayed positive and negative feedback tied to your actions and an ever increasing speed of technological innovation.

* After some self-reflection on why I am seriously considering a graduate degree, I realized that a large part of the drive came from the fact that I want to keep up with my peers and prove to the world that I'm just as "smart." In my moments of clarity I realize how terrible of a reason this is to pursue a post secondary education. However, if this insecurity and need to prove myself to others is left untreated I could end up wasting the majority of my life on pursuits that aren't aligned with what I truly desire. It's probably smart to try and fix this flawed thinking before making any huge life decisions based on what could be misguided desires.

## Reasons for Continuing Conventional Post Secondary Education Later
* My attempts at self education lack the structure and planning necessary to give me a thorough understanding of the desired subject.
* Networking with experts in the field proves to be difficult without a master's degree.
* My self directed projects don't gain enough traction to serve as a comparable "signal" to others of my understanding of a certain subject.
